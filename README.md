## 📌Project Overview
SCADA systems are widely used in industrial automation for remote monitoring and control, typically employing Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for communication. In this project, we developed a small-scale SCADA and ECU model to monitor and control engine functions. This ECU model allows for real-time sensor monitoring and actuator control, supporting functionalities like motor rotation and alarm triggers based on sensor readings.

### Core Components:
- Sensors: Temperature, pressure, oxygen, and throttle position sensors.
- Actuators: Motor control and LED indicators for alarm triggers.

## 🛠️System Design
The project incorporates an ATmega16 microcontroller to simulate real-time ECU functionality, with LabVIEW handling data acquisition and monitoring. Key elements include:

- LabVIEW as the Control Interface: Used for sensor monitoring, alarm displays, and motor speed adjustments.
- Proteus for Simulation: Used to create and simulate circuit connections with microcontroller and LabVIEW interface.

### Circuit Components
- Sensors: Inputs include temperature, engine RPM, throttle angle, and oxygen levels.
- Actuators: Outputs include motor control and LED indications.

## 🧩Implementation
The project is divided into two main parts:

- ECU Model: A model of sensor inputs and actuator outputs created in LabVIEW using mathematical representations.
- SCADA Control: Uses an ATmega16 microcontroller for data handling and control, connected to LabVIEW through virtual COM ports for bidirectional control.

## Algorithm Overview 
1. Develop sensor models in LabVIEW with graphical programming (G programming).
2. Create circuit simulation in Proteus8 and connect to LabVIEW via virtual serial port configuration.
3. Implement a control structure in LabVIEW for real-time monitoring and data flow between ECU and SCADA systems.
