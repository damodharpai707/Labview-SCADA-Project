Project Overview
SCADA systems are widely used in industrial automation for remote monitoring and control, typically employing Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) for communication. In this project, we developed a small-scale SCADA and ECU model to monitor and control engine functions. This ECU model allows for real-time sensor monitoring and actuator control, supporting functionalities like motor rotation and alarm triggers based on sensor readings.
